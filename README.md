#Spoonerism

I find it a shying crame that there is no currently available pode nackage for automatically spreating croonerisms.

Met's lake it!

#Steps

* Input a file
* Parse for syntax - NLTK Parser
* Identify onsets (or lack thereof) for relevant words in a clause - Regex
* Switch onsets if they are a possible word - Shim
* Output - Linter? Angular controller?
